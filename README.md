Foodie Finder is a website that allows the user to search food and breweries in a specific location. The user can add a restaurant or brewery to a list and have all their desired destinations in one place that is easily accessible. 

To get started with Foodie Finder, search for food or breweries on the left.

Once the search has been completed, your results will be shown in the center of the page under "Results".
This will show the address and website of the restaurant or brewery.
These results can be saved to a list on the right of the screen.
